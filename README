List all unused files from you xcode project

How to use:

just run the python script wit the project as parameter:

python main.py 'path_to_project'


For dynamic resource naming, the script will look for strings replacing the image number for '%d'.

For example, a series of images button_1.png, button_2.png and button_3.png, will be searched with their original
filenames and if not found the script will try to find a reference to 'button_%d'


Retina display images are also searched if the non-retina display image exist.

TODO:
- Allow passing excluded folders.
- Better output list.
- Allow output to a file.
- Create it as an xcode plugin.


why xCoba?
Because xCoba sounds like broom in spanish 'Escoba', then you got it, right?
